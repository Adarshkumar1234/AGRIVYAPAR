    desc: "Nano fertilizers are being studied as a way to increase nutrient efficiency and improve plant nutrition, compared with traditional fertilizers it is any product that is made with nano particles or uses nanotechnology to improve nutrient efficiency. Nano material coatings (such as a nano membrane) may slow the release of nutrients or a porous nano fertilizer may include a network of channels that retard nutrient solubility. The use of nanotechnology for fertilizers is still in its infancy but is already adopted for medical and engineering applications Another promising application of nanotechnology is the encapsulation of beneficial microorganisms that can improve plant root health. These could include various bacteria or fungi that enhance the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the root zone. The development of nano biosensors to react with specific root exudates is also being explored.",

    desc: "Using either a seed sprouting jar, sprouting tray, terra cotta sprouter, or hemp sprout bag, add about 2 tbsp Organic fenugreek sprout seeds to your container and allow seeds an initial soaking for 3-4 hours. After initial soak, continue to rinse fenugreek sprouting seeds 2-3x per day and immediately drain, not allowing water to sit and soak. Rinse seeds 2-3x per day for 2-4 days, keeping Organic fenugreek sprouts fresh, crunchy, and hydrated without waterlogging. Non-GMO fenugreek sprouts are quick to harvest in just 2-4 days, ready for fresh use with the seeds having a distinct maple scent, while the sprouts have a bitter  bite. Fenugreek sprouting seeds grow a protein-rich sprout fortified with fiber, iron, potassium, manganese, and vitamins B6, C and only about 60 calories per cup.",

It is important that an electric motor be correctly selected for size and application, installed and operated appropriately, and periodically maintained. Incorrect operating voltage, overloading, lack of ventilation, and/or high temperatures can result in overheating which, in turn, typically results in low operation efficiency and/or motor failure.",
